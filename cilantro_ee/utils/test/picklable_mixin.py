"""
This class is a drop-in mixin to add support for pickling objects that have loggers. By default, loggers are not
picklable (basically b/c they use some non-picklable lock objects), thus any logger objects must be removed from the
object before they are pickled, and recreated when they are unloaded.

Assumes the Logger object is an instance property called 'log'
